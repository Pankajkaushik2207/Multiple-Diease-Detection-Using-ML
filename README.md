# Multiple-Disease-Prediction-System

## Project Overview

This project focuses on leveraging machine learning models to predict multiple diseases. The models are trained and tested using datasets sourced from Kaggle. The accompanying web application is developed using Python's Streamlit library, providing an interactive interface for users.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
- **Kaggle Datasets**: Access to relevant datasets from Kaggle.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Optional but recommended for exploring and understanding the data.

## Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: For efficient data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Essential for numerical computing tasks.
- **Scikit-learn**: Utilized for building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Pickle**: Used to save and load machine learning models.
- **Streamlit**: Employed for creating the user-friendly web application.

## Project Procedure

1. **Import Libraries and Datasets**: Start by importing the necessary libraries and loading the diabetic and heart disease datasets.

2. **Data Preparation**: Split the data into features and target variables to facilitate model training.

3. **Data Splitting**: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to assess model performance accurately.

4. **Model Training**: Train the machine learning models using the training data.

5. **Model Persistence**: Save the trained models using the Pickle module, allowing for easy retrieval and reuse.

6. **Web Application Development**: Leverage Streamlit to create an intuitive web application. This application enables users to input their own data and receive predictions using the saved models.

7. **User Interaction**: Implement a user-friendly interface with a button for processing user input and generating predictions.
